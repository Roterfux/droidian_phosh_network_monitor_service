# droidian phosh network monitor service
Since the network-stack for wifi and mobile-data is a bit flacky, I decided to inform myself about issues, without countermeasures for now.

Monitors network connection via wifi or mobile-data every 3minutes.
Start, stop and monitor service via Phosh Gui. With addiitonal basic network quailty indicators.
If the network is gone, a notification is fired. And the other way around.
